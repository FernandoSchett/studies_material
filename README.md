## About 🤔:

This is where I store all my study materials and references related to programming and engineering andcomputer science, with a primary focus on my college coursework. Here, you'll find a collection of resources that I've gathered and organized to aid my learning journey.

This repository serves as a central hub for my educational materials, allowing me to access them conveniently whenever I need to review or expand my knowledge. From coding examples and project prototypes to insightful articles and tutorials, everything relevant to my studies can be found here.

In addition to my study materials, I also maintain another [repository](https://github.com/FernandoSchett/hall_of_fame) that holds information about influential scientists and individuals whom I admire. It serves as a source of inspiration, allowing me to learn more about their work and contributions to the field of science and technology, do not forget to check it out :).

Feel free to explore the contents of this repository and utilize any resources that may be helpful to you. Whether you're a fellow student, a programmer, or simply curious about the world of computer science, I hope you find value in the materials I've gathered.


## Resourses 🧑‍🔬:

- Useful Links: A curated collection of links to websites, blogs, forums, and online resources related to programming and computer science. These links serve as valuable references and sources of information for various topics.

- Libraries and Useful Functions: A directory containing different libraries and useful functions that you have gathered during your studies. These resources can assist in enhancing your coding productivity and solving common programming challenges.

- Courses: A compilation of course materials, lecture notes, and assignments from your college coursework or online courses. This section provides a structured learning experience and allows you to revisit course content whenever needed.

- Base Codes: A repository of foundational code snippets and templates that serve as starting points for your projects. These codes can help you kickstart your development process and provide a solid foundation for building more complex applications.

- Articles, PDFs, and Useful Images: A collection of articles, research papers, PDF documents, and relevant images related to programming and computer science. These resources offer additional insights, in-depth explanations, and visual aids to enhance your understanding of various concepts and topics.

## Dependencies 🚚:

The project dependencies are described in a dependencies file within the repository. In summary, heres what you're gonna need in order to run the project:

- none yet :p
- 

For installing dependencies more quickly, you can run the following command at terminal, inside the clonned repository:

    pip3 install -r ./dependencies/requirements.txt

Make sure you have the dependencies required before running the any codes in here.

## How to run codes fomr here 🏃:

First, clone this repository. In the top of each code file, has a manual with instructions for compiling, running, it's porpouse and other information. They usually look like the template below:

	/*
	File:           filne_name.ext
	Last changed:   xx/xx/20xx xx:xx
	Purpose:        Code for hard problems         
	Authors:        Fernando Antônio Marques Schettini   
	Usage: 
		HowToCompile:   gcc filne_name.cpp -o file_name
		HowToExecute:   ./file_name           
	*/ 

## Development Process ⚙️:

Over time, I organized this repository based on my academic journey, starting from my undergraduate studies. I categorized study materials as I progressed, adding useful links, libraries, functions, courses, base codes, and relevant articles. The structure was continually adjusted to reflect my progress and facilitate access to resources. This repository is a representation of my academic path and my commitment to continuous learning in programming, computer  engineering and computer science.
